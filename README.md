# black_holes_backend

Welcome to the blackholeNotblackhole project!

This is the backend for our web app, so we'll be writing server-side code to communicate with the frontend, 
store information in our database, and build the neural net to find galaxies with 'fossil' black holes.

# Background

For a quick intro to the project check out the MVP in <a href="https://github.com/codeforgoodconf/black_holes_backend/blob/master/notes.md">notes.md</a>. For more detailed description, check out the <a href="https://github.com/codeforgoodconf/black_holes_backend/blob/master/ML_Info/Project_Information.pdf">ML_Info/Project_Information.pdf</a> directory

# Technology

We'll be building a Django app using either React or Angular. We'll need a local server, so probably with Nginx and Guincorn.
