# black_holes_frontend

Welcome to the blackholeNotblackhole project!

This is the frontend for our web app, so we'll be designing the UX and building functionality 
for a few modules to communicate with our backend.

# Technology

We'll be building a Django app using either React or Angular. We'll need a local server, so probably with Nginx and Guincorn.
